I just spent an hour talking between Hong Kong and Canada on my cell phone because you guys started including my cellphone line in the Viber app. I didn't notice that I was returning the call on my cellphone line and that's going to cost me a lot of money.

The activation call is from a hidden Private number so you can't see the last 4 numbers which is the activation code .Then they send you an activation code via sms which is 6digits while the app asks 4 digits... I wonder which genius there on Viber thought this method of verifying and activating accounts by sending 6 digit activation codes to 4 digits requests... He should work on Space X or NASA.,1

5569840b-2e2a-43af-a1f0-2f108b70e4c4,"There's still a delay in sending messages. When calling someone there are a lot of times that the call doesn't actually go through and it's noticeable as the ring tone you hear is different. The other persons sees a ""missed call"" even though it never rang on their end. Also, I preferred the AI you previously had rather than ChatGPT, at least the old one carried conversations and wrote more like a person rather than a bot.",2

Viber never gets better, after more than 10 years of using it, it only makes me hate it even more every use. Calls are of bad quality, messages are late and so are notifications. They only appear once when i enter the app, but i believe i don't have to explain why its useless. When sending photos, they mix. It became so laggy for no reason, and all these adds...

To me this is unwanted spam, and dealing with it is waste of time and inconvenience. 2. Constant suggestions for people to follow, i can choose on my own whom to follow, i do not need someone to suggest me. 3. Constant nagging about stickers, i do not want so much bloat, and all these suggestions, are a distraction and i do like it. Sorry but im not interested in viber app anymore.",1

362ad343-785b-495c-8b3f-fb3e8a743cc0,"- Viber is one of the worst messaging/calling apps when it comes to call quality (audio & video). We compared it to 20 popular chat/call apps using the Pixel 8 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and S24 Ultra. - It sends and receives messages later than others, even on the same WiFi or 5G connection. - When sending multiple photos, it scatters them one by one rather than in a collage format (like Telegram, etc.). - The advertisements are obtrusive. - It needs a complete UI overhaul Viber, wake up!",1
4b32aff3-f84e-4e96-b38e-8418eee04489,"I suggest Viber should also include ""Notes"" like from other social platform to know the status of the user and inform everyone in their contacts, if their busy, away, sick or remotely active. Viber as well, should include.. again.. suggesting the internal screenlock for its app. Overall, love how they added ""Folders"" to manage chat. I think, they should add more folders to manage some of the chats. Thank you! Hope this will be considered.",3

Viber's arbitrary account blocking policy fails to address false positives, despite user complaints. Until Viber improves its support and policies, I can't trust or recommend the platform.",1
