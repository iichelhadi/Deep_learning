Recently every time I close the app it starts with lady gaga or Sabrina carpenter as what I'm last listening to and I've never listened to that garbage.

92f950f3-d913-42e2-8388-ea0b6fa45197,I used Spotify for the past few years and the free version is horrible. You can't do anything about the way you listen to songs in the free version and you're forced to shuffle with songs that you didn't add in playlists. And for all the features for a good music app being behind an expensive pay wall is really not adding to the good things about the app. Hope you realize that maybe you should have fewer features locked so that more people can enjoy the app without so many self ads.,2

Massive variety of music and overall a pretty good app, but a serious problem is that there is nothing in settings to disable the 'smart shuffle' permanently.

cdc41899-dd74-4ba1-b6f0-74fa062f5cf2,I use Spotify for my phone alarm and its worked fine for years cycling a new song each time for something fresh each morning. But for a few weeks now ever time its the same song. I finally figured out that the cycle setting turns off in Spotify when the app is closed forcing my phone alarm to always use the top song on the list. This is annoying and needs to be looked at. It started doing this again after stopping. Tried to go to the support forums can't even leave a reply because now I get eror,1

b1056d7c-8115-413f-9969-976b955825bc,I pay for spotify premium. Podcasts all have ads built into them so you're forced to deal with them.

There should be a way to prevent an artist from populating a song radio that isn't flat out blocking them. If I'm trying to listen to MCR I don't want Korn and Slipknot... that doesn't mean I hate Korn or Slipknot it just means that that's not the vibe I'm looking for right now...? Sometimes that is the vibe so it feels stupid blocking them just to make my song radio not populate wrong,1

The shuffle feature is useless it plays the same stuff all the time.
