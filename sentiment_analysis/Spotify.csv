Recently every time I close the app it starts with lady gaga or Sabrina carpenter as what I'm last listening to and I've never listened to that garbage. This company is getting worse by the day with their forcing certain songs and bands into your Playlist even after you say you want less of it. I will be moving over to Apple or another service.",1

92f950f3-d913-42e2-8388-ea0b6fa45197,I used Spotify for the past few years and the free version is horrible. You can't do anything about the way you listen to songs in the free version and you're forced to shuffle with songs that you didn't add in playlists. And for all the features for a good music app being behind an expensive pay wall is really not adding to the good things about the app. Hope you realize that maybe you should have fewer features locked so that more people can enjoy the app without so many self ads.,2

Another thing is the app will constantly put itself on replay. If I did not have premium I would be more upset. Pandora seems better atp.,3

Now they've even broken Play and Pause (each take 5+ seconds to take effect). That's after they broke shuffle (only shuffles the same 30-40 tracks in a playlist), offline mode (not broken, but buried), on and on. I reinstalled with no improvement. They need to stop with the silly fluffy ai nonsense. FIX THE BASICS LIKE PLAY AND PAUSE, then spend time on this fluff that nobody wants.",2

Worse yet, even with the free version, enjoying your music is nearly impossible. Songs are often interrupted.

What's the point of this app if I can't listen to the song I want to? I could just turn on the radio instead. It also doesn't allow you to listen to specific parts of the song or to skip the song.

As someone who remained on the free version, it's really annoying. I have to pay to see the lyrics or to remove shuffle mode. The app is extremely greedy and has too many ads. It says that you have 30 minutes of no ads, and shows you 4 ads per song. It says it's offline while every other app on my phone has internet.",2

I might as well be deaf by now. Also why isn't there a true shuffle? What is the shuffle Funktion for if all it does is let the same 15 songs cycle out of my playlist of over 1000 songs? Add to that the app doesn't actually download all the songs in my downloaded playlists. Dissapointed.",3

Having 3 albums from an artist in your library doesn't mean you can just play those albums with ease, you have to go to each album individually and add them to a queue... A queue that can't be shuffled and the songs are removed when they finish playing so if you wanted to go back you can't. The only solution is making playlists for every artist... Dumb",1

How greedy do they have to be to literally force all users into premium, pushing an ad after every single song, not allowing skips, and now u can't even choose which song/playlist to play after 6 skips.

7395b8c0-2470-4d36-87c9-a750c8d83251,"Reducing my long held 5⭐ review and dropped a star to four ✨ and potentiallly falling. I have believed that Spotify is one app I couldn't do without. But since trialling YouTube premium this month my opinion is changing. One of the key Spotify Premium attributes was ad-free listening. Now, so many (if not all), podcasts have been supported to introduce adverts through out their shows. I hate the ads and the ads can come at anytime and multiple times throughout. Time for a change I feel.",4

It honestly does frustrate me at times, I wish we could go back to a legitimate SHUFFLE, a random variety of what I have saved.",3

Unfortunately, the new update disappoint me. Lately, I've found myself using Spotify less because of it. The fact that you now need Premium to access all songs and skip as much as you want is a bit frustrating. The constant pop-up about having “6 skips per hour” really limits the experience. I hope there's a way to adjust this. Thank you, Spotify!",4

Lack of options is a sad reason to be shackled to a poorly-designed app. And forced shuffle mode for music is such a garbage policy. Music streaming apps need to dump these bad business practices; I'm not paying for a poorly-designed app just to get out of shuffle. I'm much more likely to never give you a chance ever again.",2

233f9f27-807a-43be-8f39-1e3e78d8ca71,"My favorite thing about Spotify is how the DJ plays the same exact songs over and over. Especially when it says, ""Here's one you haven't heard before,"" then proceeds to play a song it's played to you 700 times before. Then how it eventually starts playing music so far out of the realm of what you actually like that it provokes a physical reaction of disgust from you. Rock fan? Dj is gonna hook you up with Indian folklore music after a long day at work. Rap fan? Prepare for Russian death metal.",2

Get a third party patcher for the app, trust me. Rhymes with manager. Good luck",2

There should be a way to prevent an artist from populating a song radio that isn't flat out blocking them. If I'm trying to listen to MCR I don't want Korn and Slipknot... that doesn't mean I hate Korn or Slipknot it just means that that's not the vibe I'm looking for right now...? Sometimes that is the vibe so it feels stupid blocking them just to make my song radio not populate wrong,1

8c76508d-0bc9-444a-9d54-23cbeb8530bc,I absolutely love Spotify but if you're going to get it get the premium! Why because it tells you here's 30 minutes of commercial free music and then your song starts playing and then the next one please. And then you get five commercials. It's kind of frustrating so you might as well pay and get the bigger plan.,3

It makes it impossible to listen on your phone for longer than 10 seconds before automatically switching back to your laptop. Also, there is absolutely no way to fix this. They've had years to fix this, and have just decided not to. Their solution? Logout of all of your other devices. What a joke.",1

The app is laggy and unreliable. It's constantly freezing and restarting songs now. I never had that problem before. Smart shuffle is glitchy at best. When it's on, i can't select the song i want to hear, which defeats the purpose of paying for the service. I've stopped paying for spotify. Until stuff is put back the way it was, I will be using youtube music. ✌🏾",2

I had it for years for daily listening during commute with numerous playlist. All I wanted is to listen to the song I want, not the one tour algorithm randomly decides. Good days are gone!",1

Just like every other successful piece of software they endlessly tweak everything and anything all the time, whether it's needed or not, so their large team of developers always have something to do and the managers have something to crow about. Meanwhile the users suffer. The latest awesome thing is that when I make playlists on my PC they do not sync to my account on my phone until days later. Great job, guys 👍",2

6bba61c1-e1d8-4a04-81a9-bab1400a15fd,Spotify is one step above a non-functional app. it literally takes me 5 minutes to get music playing. so clunky. so laggy. the UI is organized horrible. tech support is never helpful. thier remidy is to always try to clear the cache. maybe you should fix the app. I could rant for about an hour about how bad this app is. but unfortunately I pay for this and have many lengthy playlists that it too hard to transfer to another platform.,1
3e137b2c-8093-4a20-af23-1fc6c69bc24a,"The update basically broke Spotify. Shuffle barely works, every couple songs it switches itself back to ""smart suggestions"" after I've already turned it off two songs before, and the app crashes constantly. Shuffle just repeats the same set of songs all day. For prices going up, having a hard limit on audiobook hours seems redundant. I can barely finish one book before I'm already out for an entire month: going back to music does nothing as it won't shuffle correctly.",3

Now it seems like can't stop running into bugs and can't disable certain settings. The smart shuffle function broke the shuffle button. Unnecessary things that should be optional on the app but due to Spotify forcing them there are countless bugs now. I hope Spotify can once again become the company they once were and once again produce happy customers.,2

And I have heard Amazon ad 4 times continuously.,1

A lot of people want to listen to songs in peace,and you're just ruining it because of the stupid PREMIUM. And it's not even cheap,it's expensive. Even my parents don't want to download this..",2

On YouTube you get about 1-3s of ad roll per 1 min of song AND unlimited skips. Spotify is better for discovering new music via playlists, but YouTube is a superior listening experience.

Sometimes when you hit play on a playlist on shuffle, the first 10 songs you heard the last time you shuffled the same playlist come on. Sometimes you will hear the same song twice in a 100 song playlist before you hear the song you've been waiting for. Fix the shuffle, Spotify. This is a hill I am willing to die on.",1

From dropping all contents out of your carefully crafted queue (oh, but I get how difficult it is for software to keep track of a list /sarcasm) to simply shutting down while playing content to refusing to shutdown when you want it shut down, the quality of the app is, generously, abysmal. I switched to another solution and could not be happier. I encourage you to migrate away from Spotify, too.",1
