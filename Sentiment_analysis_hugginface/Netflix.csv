Netflix are still taking too long to follow up with series that are already available to watch. They are so fond of excessive editing and cutting of programmes as well. Services needs to improve. In 2024 Netflix is even worse than before by starting to advertise on a site that we joined under the belief that there was no adverts shown during viewing which is why we subscribed in the first place.,1

643be162-e173-46b5-ad33-6962a93f2cc7,Unable to uninstall - Cancelled Netflix when they decided it was more important to hook new users than develop existing shows. Cancelling the OA and the Santa Clarita Diet was proof there was no point in investing your time in their shows. Cracking down on sharing passwords was the final nail in the coffin of me giving this company another penny. The fact your can't even delete their app from your phone shows that this is a completely unethical company.,1

I was a customer for 9 years & never shared my password or account info. I had to pay for an extra screen just to have it play in the background at my shop. The final straw was them asking me to pay for another screen on the SAME wifi network at home! I had a wifi signal booster in my bedroom and it read it as another household. This is an absolutely disgusting company.,1

Why put a show on my main screen from 2018 with 1 season. Who is going to bother watching that and I really can't stand how they don't have a list of everything available to go through. Yet 1 show is seen 10 times on main screen. Ridiculous 90% of content is unseen. Even search is terrible. Search 'T' and Movies starting with S come up.,1

27ceeeeb-994b-478b-b9fe-334fb8fcf0aa,Update - at $23 i CANCELLED! WHY CANT I FILTER OUT WATCHED ITEMS! Raised prices again for horrible movies and rating system. If ads are ever added I'm 100% GONE. I'm paying for 5 streaming services now and Netflix is the most expensive and least relevant. 1 ad = cancelled. We're overloaded with foreign movies and about 15% american movies now. Its disgusting at this point. You're charging extra for mediocre content! FORCING OTHER COUNTRIES TRASH ON US IS WHY YOUR SERVICE IS WORSE THAN HULU!!,1

They have hundreds going on thousands of hours of sketch comedy and is only $6 month or $60 a year. 5The CEO writes and hosts shows where the other writers are the stars. It feels good to watch and support Dropout.TV. If Netflix gets back to that level they can have 5 stars too.,1
