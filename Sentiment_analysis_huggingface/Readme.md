# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset into ten different categories using PyTorch.

## Overview

The `Torch_image_classification.ipynb` notebook contains the full implementation of the CIFAR-10 image classifier, including data loading, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib notebook

### Project Structure

    Torch_image_classification.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing all the code for the CIFAR-10 image classification task.
    data/: (optional) Directory for storing the CIFAR-10 dataset if downloaded locally.
    models/: (optional) Directory for saving trained models.

### Results

After training, the model's accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test set will be displayed. You can also visualize some of the test images along with their predicted labels.
