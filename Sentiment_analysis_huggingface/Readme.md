# Sentiment Analysis with Hugging Face

This project uses Hugging Face's Transformers library to perform sentiment analysis on text data. The model is fine-tuned to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Overview

The `huggingface_sentiment_analysis.ipynb` notebook provides the complete implementation for training and evaluating a sentiment analysis model using a pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face's Transformers library.

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- transformers
- torch
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install transformers torch pandas numpy matplotlib notebook
```
### Project Structure

- huggingface_sentiment_analysis.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for sentiment analysis using Hugging Face's Transformers.

### Results

After training, the model's performance metrics (such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score) will be displayed. You can also visualize the predictions on a sample of the test data.
